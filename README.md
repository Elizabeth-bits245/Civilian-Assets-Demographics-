📈 Detailed Insights

1. Car Ownership by Gender

Males: 787 cars

🔍 Insight: Males own more cars, but Females are highlighted as the top car segment, likely due to higher car ownership per capita or growth trend.
2. Income by Region

North America: $32M
Europe & Pacific: $13M each
🔍 Insight: North America earns more than double compared to Europe and Pacific. This could influence asset acquisition power.

Bachelor’s: 444
Partial College: 403
High School: 341
🔍 Insight: Higher education generally correlates with more car ownership, but Graduate Degrees (126) are surprisingly lower — potentially due to age, urban location, or income constraints.

📌 Strategic Recommendations

Target High-Income Regions (North America):
Promote premium asset products (cars, homes) in this region.
Bike Campaigns for Youth:
Focus marketing toward younger age groups with health and eco-friendly messaging.
Support for High-Child Households:
Create financial programs or car purchase plans tailored to large families (3+ children), who may earn less.
Car Sales Linked to Education:
College-educated demographics (Bachelor’s, Partial College) are key targets for car marketing.
Bundle Products for Homeowners:
Since homeowners are more likely to own cars, bundling insurance, financing, or vehicle maintenance may add value.
